# Usage

## 1. Open the app

Launch **DSH Desktop** after installation. It starts a local web service and opens a native window.

## 2. Add your API key

Open the in-app settings and paste your [DeepSeek API Key](https://platform.deepseek.com/) — same flow as the web version.

## 3. Start a conversation

Ask the AI to run tasks for you: read/write files, execute commands, write code, automate operations.

## Where your data lives

Conversations, configuration, and sessions are stored in the system application data directory — they never pollute your user home. Diagnostic logs are written to `logs/dsh.log` under that same directory.

If the app ever fails to open or the UI stays blank, that log file is the first place to look — the tray menu's "Open log" and "Open data directory" entries take you straight to both locations.
